    <p class="content">
        A comma-separated list of selectors represents the union of all elements selected by each of the individual
        selectors in the list. (A comma is U+002C.) For example, in CSS when several selectors share the same
        declarations, they may be grouped into a comma-separated list. White space may appear before and/or after the
        comma.

    <p class="bold-text">CSS example</p>

    <p class="content">In this example, we condense three rules with identical declarations into one. Thus,</p>

    <pre class="code-block">
h1 { font-family: sans-serif }
h2 { font-family: sans-serif }
h3 { font-family: sans-serif }
is equivalent to:
h1, h2, h3 { font-family: sans-serif }
